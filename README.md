# Matrix-Matrix Multiplicator
A simple program written in C, that performs standard matrix-matrix multiplication.

## Running this program:
Install gcc, and run this command:
`gcc ./src/main.c -o main && ./main`
(there is also a pre-built binary that I accidentally left in which might also work)

## Notes
I may make this into a small header library, not sure yet.
Depends on if the libraries I'm using already have matrix capabilities in them.
