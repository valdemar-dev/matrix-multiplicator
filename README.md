# Matrix-Matrix Multiplicator
A simple program written in C, that performs standard matrix-matrix multiplication.

## Running this program:

### C compiler
Ensure you have GCC or some other c compiler.

### Compile & Run with GCC
`gcc ./src/main.c -o main && ./main`

## Notes
I may make this into a small header library, not sure yet.
Depends on if the libraries I'm using already have matrix capabilities in them.
